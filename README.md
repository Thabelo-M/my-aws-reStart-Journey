# My Restart Graduate Journey
The Restart program is designed to take you from a beginner in tech to a confident, job-ready professional. During the program, I learned:
- Cloud Computing – Understanding AWS services, deploying applications, and managing infrastructure.
- Programming & Scripting – Building logic with Python, automating tasks, and working with data.
- Databases & Storage – Designing, creating, and querying relational and NoSQL databases.
- Networking & Security – Basics of networking, VPNs, subnets, and security best practices.
- Professional Skills – Git, GitHub, documentation, teamwork, and problem-solving.

Restart teaches you not only how to use tools but also why they matter in real-world IT environments. It encourages hands-on practice, building projects, and documenting your progress, so you can confidently demonstrate your skills to employers.
